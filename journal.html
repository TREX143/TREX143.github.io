	Dear journal, <br>
<br>
	I learned how to push my changes to my website online. I read the article about <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I added an animation to my projects page and I think I'm finally starting to understand how exactly to create an effective menu bar with buttons. <br>

	Dear journal, <br>
<br>
	I learned how to create buttons on my website and make them link to different things, such as this journal, projects, and about me. I figured out how to create a menu bar, give it color, and make my stuff look cool. I am continuing to solidify my foundation in html by practicing things like various tags and the basic blueprint for a website in html: head (with a title section) and body (with everything else like paragraphs, style). I am overall having fun even though not every task in html is easy to tackle. <br>

	Dear journal, <br>
<br>
	I watched the html videos and learned all about the html coding language. I learned that it is primarily made up of tags, which is text in between angle brackets < and >. I also learned about how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create a website. <strong> HTML </strong> creates the <strong> content </strong> of the website, <strong> CSS styles </strong> up the website, and <strong> Javascript </strong> makes it <strong> interactive</strong>. Coding in these languages so far makes me feel <em> pretty empowered </em> because I can create my own website with my own interests reflected in it. Just in writing this journal entry, I am practicing some tags like break, strong, and em. <br>
