Final Project!!! <br>
<br>
	Dear Journal, <br>
<br>
	For my final project this year, I created a manual for learning a piano piece. First, I created a homepage with an image of a cake and the three layers I believe are integral to learning a piece. I added some general instructions for using the guide as the text on this homepage. I then linked to three other pages, each of which contains details on a step in the learning process. For the first two steps' pages, I displayed an image of sheet music and annotated it for key concepts, also including text on the side as a guide. On the page for the last step, I incorporated a music player (event listener) that plays a recording of me playing a new piece. The main motivation for creating this project was to share my passion for piano. <br>

Car project <br>
<br>
	Dear Journal, <br>
<br>
	This car project is also one of my favorite projects. First, I created a div square with a background image of a car and also set the background image of the whole page to a road. Next, I created an event listener that listens for when you press either the left or right arrow keys and then moves the car accordingly. Lastly, there was some orientation I needed to do so I could get the car exactly on the road where I wanted it to be, the right size in proportion to the road, and driving at the speed I wanted. This project was really interesting and fun, both because I like cars and also because it felt like a small, fun interactive car game in a way. <br>

Circle blob project <br>
<br>
	Dear Journal, <br>
<br>
	I created a really cool project that is now probably my favorite project of all: the circle blob. This project first created a div circle that had other circles of many other sizes revolving around it (essentially, it made the one circle div include all of the other circles). Then it used both a function to randomize the colors of the circles and also an event listener randomizing the position of the circles around my moving mouse. This project was super fun and I felt accomplished after I finished it, especially because I had some trouble at first and along the way of creating the project. <br>

Mouse follower project <br>
<br>
	Dear Journal, <br>
<br>
	I learned how to create an project that incorporated an image that can follow your mouse. This project also qualifies as an animation. This project first created a div box that had the background image url of a football player and then used an event listener that made the football player follow my mouse wherever it moved around on the page. Then I put background images of a football field and a field goal to make it look like the player was running around on the field in a game. <br>

Square Quilt <br>
<br>
	Dear Journal, <br>
<br>
	I learned how to create a "quilt" or array of different images in my folder. This consisted of a function called makeSquare, which made different divs/squares with different background images. it also incorporated append child, which I thought was cool. <br>
<br>
<br>

Array project <br>
<br>
	Dear Journal, <br>
<br>
	I learned how to create an array. My array project was a breakfast-selecting machine that had instructions to click on the images until finding a breakfast that you like and want to eat. I created an event listener that listened for my mouse click and at each one, cycled through a list/set of images in my folder. I learned more about event listeners and how to use them through this project. <br>
<br>
<br>
Animations <br>
<br>
	Dear Journal, <br>
<br>
	I learned how to make animations, whether it was creating dancing squares or a color changing page. For my color changing page, I used event listeners for when I move my mouse and assigned different colors to this "mousemove". This was a fun project that helped me learn even more about event listeners and how to use them. <br>
<br>
<br>
Music player <br>
<br>
	Dear Journal, <br>
<br>
	I learned how to make a page that plays music when you click on it. The piece of music I put in was Un Sospiro by Liszt. This was a fun project that helped me learn more about event listeners and how to use them. <br>
<br>
<br>

	Dear Journal, <br>
<br>
	I learned how to push my changes to my website online. I read the article about <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I added an animation to my projects page and I think I'm finally starting to understand how exactly to create an effective menu bar with buttons. <br>

	Dear Journal, <br>
<br>
	I learned how to create buttons on my website and make them link to different things, such as this journal, projects, and about me. I figured out how to create a menu bar, give it color, and make my stuff look cool. I am continuing to solidify my foundation in html by practicing things like various tags and the basic blueprint for a website in html: head (with a title section) and body (with everything else like paragraphs, style). I am overall having fun even though not every task in html is easy to tackle. <br>

	Dear Journal, <br>
<br>
	I watched the html videos and learned all about the html coding language. I learned that it is primarily made up of tags, which is text in between angle brackets < and >. I also learned about how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create a website. <strong> HTML </strong> creates the <strong> content </strong> of the website, <strong> CSS styles </strong> up the website, and <strong> Javascript </strong> makes it <strong> interactive</strong>. Coding in these languages so far makes me feel <em> pretty empowered </em> because I can create my own website with my own interests reflected in it. Just in writing this journal entry, I am practicing some tags like break, strong, and em. <br>
